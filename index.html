    <p> created a user's github page here at https://github.com/avi-aryan/avi-aryan.github.com

Now, suppose I have an Image file at the root of the repo located as Images/Emoticons/Cool.png

I try to insert that image in my main Index.html file.
I write -
- <img src="\images\emoticons\cool.png"> and nothing shows up online and offline
- <img src="images\emoticons\cool.png"> and nothing shows up online but I can see the image offline
- <img src="..\images\emoticons\cool.png"> and nothing shows up online and offline

      What should be done?</p>
